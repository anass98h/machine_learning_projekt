    "# Software Development - Sprint 4 Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This report details the implementation of quality assurance measures for our Movement Analysis Project, focusing on testing, documentation, and continuous integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timeline of Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Backend Testing Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Added pytest framework to the FastAPI backend\n",
    "- Created test structure for two main components:\n",
    "    - Model loader tests: Verifying model loading and versioning\n",
    "    - API endpoint tests: Testing HTTP responses and error handling\n",
    "- Implemented mock tests to avoid dependency on actual ML models\n",
    "- Added test configurations using pytest.ini\n",
    "\n",
    "Key achievements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete test coverage for model loading functionality\n",
    "- API endpoint validation\n",
    "- Error handling verification\n",
    "- Proper separation of test and production code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Frontend Testing Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented React component testing\n",
    "- Set up testing environment with necessary configurations\n",
    "- Created tests for:\n",
    "    - Component rendering\n",
    "    - User interactions\n",
    "    - API integration\n",
    "    - Error state handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proper component isolation\n",
    "- Mock API responses\n",
    "- State management testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Development Guidelines Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Created comprehensive documentation covering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project structure and setup\n",
    "- Code quality standards\n",
    "    - Python: black, flake8, isort\n",
    "    - JavaScript: ESLint, Prettier\n",
    "- Development workflows\n",
    "- Testing procedures\n",
    "- Git practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Key decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chose requirements.txt over Poetry for simplicity\n",
    "- Standardized commit message format\n",
    "- Established clear branching strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. GitHub Actions Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented CI/CD pipeline with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automated testing for all components\n",
    "- Initial code quality checks (focusing on tests first)\n",
    "- Build verification\n",
    "- Branch protection rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on Linting Integration:\n",
    "We are taking a phased approach to introducing linting checks in our CI/CD pipeline. This strategic decision was made to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow the team to gradually adapt to code style requirements\n",
    "- Prevent overwhelming developers with too many changes at once\n",
    "- Ensure our existing codebase can be brought up to standards incrementally\n",
    "- Maintain development velocity while improving code quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Status:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing checks are fully implemented\n",
    "- Basic formatting checks are in place\n",
    "- Linting rules are being introduced progressively\n",
    "- Team is experimenting with linting configurations locally before CI enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete local linting setup documentation\n",
    "- Gather feedback on initial linting rules\n",
    "- Gradually enable linting checks in CI\n",
    "- Full linting integration expected by next sprint\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separate checks for ML, Backend, and Frontend\n",
    "- Combined workflow for full project verification\n",
    "- Automated quality assurance on pull requests\n",
    "- Phased introduction of linting rules\n",
    "\n",
