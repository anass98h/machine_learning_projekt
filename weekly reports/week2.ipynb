    "# Machine Learning Project Report\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explored various approaches to building a linear regression model. Our goal was to see how different data manipulations would affect the model’s performance. Below is a summary of our experiments and findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version 1 (v1)\n",
    "- **Method**: \n",
    "  - We started by training a linear regression model on the raw data.\n",
    "  - The data was split into training and test sets without any preprocessing or feature manipulation.\n",
    "  - This model was saved as **v1** in our `ML/saved_model` directory.\n",
    "- **Result**:\n",
    "  - **R Squared**: 0.61637  \n",
    "  - **MSE**: 0.0229\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version 2 (v2)\n",
    "- **Method**: \n",
    "  - We tried dropping one column from each pair of symmetrical columns from the dataset before training.\n",
    "  - We then retrained the linear regression model.\n",
    "- **Result**:\n",
    "  - **R Squared**: 0.61700  \n",
    "  - **MSE**: 0.0228\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version 3 (v3)\n",
    "- **Method**:\n",
    "  - We computed the correlation matrix for our features and dropped the least correlated columns (with respect to the target variable).\n",
    "  - We also tested combinations including dropping symmetrical columns alongside the least correlated ones.\n",
    "  - The best outcome in this version came from only dropping FSM.\n",
    "- **Result**:\n",
    "  - **R Squared**: 0.62206  \n",
    "  - **MSE**: 0.0225\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version 4 (v4) – *Champion Model*\n",
    "- **Method**:\n",
    "  - We multiplied the symmetrical columns to create a new feature and added it to the dataset.\n",
    "  - We also tried creating an average of the symmetrical columns and dropping the originals, but that gave worse results.\n",
    "  - After experimentation, the best performing approach in v4 was to use the newly created column from the multiplied symmetrical features.\n",
    "- **Result**:\n",
    "  - **R Squared**: 0.64677  \n",
    "  - **MSE**: 0.0210\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes\n",
    "- We tried weighting some of the features based on guidelines provided by the organization, but it did not improve model accuracy.\n",
    "- Overall, **v4** gave us the highest R² and the lowest MSE, making it our **champion model**.\n",

    "### Key Features\n",
    "1. **Make Prediction**\n",
    "   - Allows users to upload a file.\n",
    "   - Provides a dropdown to select a regression model.\n",
    "   - Sends the data to the backend for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prediction Results**\n",
    "   - Displays prediction scores and corresponding risk categories.\n",
    "   - Includes a **speedometer visualization** for easy interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Health System**\n",
    "   - Monitors the system status.\n",
    "   - Displays whether the system is in a **healthy** state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Management**\n",
    "   - Allows users to update and refresh available models.\n",
    "   - Ensures the latest models are accessible for predictions.\n",

    "## Integration\n",
    "- The frontend interacts with the backend via API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend Implementation\n",
    "The backend is built with **FastAPI** and it is responsible for handling machine learning predictions, model management, and health monitoring. It consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Models\n",
    "- Supports multiple pre-trained models that can be selected by the user.\n",
    "- Predictions return a **performance score** categorized into four risk levels:\n",
    "  - **Bad (0-39):** Poor performance or high risk.\n",
    "  - **Good (40-69):** Acceptable performance or moderate risk.\n",
    "  - **Great (70-89):** Strong performance or low risk.\n",
    "  - **Excellent (90-100):** Exceptional performance or minimal risk.\n",
    "\n",

    "The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for:\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Accepts a file and model selection, then returns predictions.\n",
    "- **Health Status**: Monitors system health and displays status.\n",
    "- **Model Management**: Allows updating and refreshing available models.\n",

    "   - Starting next week, we will integrate MLflow into all new experiments.\n",
    "   - Ensure that metrics, hyperparameters, and model versions are systematically tracked.\n",
    "   - This will streamline comparison between different model iterations.\n",
